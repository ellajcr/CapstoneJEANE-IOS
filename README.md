### **Introduction**

This iOS app builds on my 2024 UW Informatics Capstone project that addresses the question:  
**"How might middle school students achieve proper usage of AI tools to improve their digital literacy?"**

My team and I prototyped an educational platform designed to empower middle school students with the knowledge and skills necessary for responsible AI usage. The platform focuses on key concepts including:
- **Prompt engineering**
- **Identifying misinformation** in outputs generated by ChatGPT
- **Understanding the nuances** of AI usage in educational settings

After completing the project, I independently developed this iOS app based on the materials created during the capstone.
