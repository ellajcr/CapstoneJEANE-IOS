**Introduction**
This iOS app builds on a 2024 UW Informatics Capstone project. Our team's project tackles a crucial question in today's digital age: "How might middle school students achieve proper usage of AI tools to improve their digital literacy?"
My team and I prototyped an educational platform aimed at empowering middle school students with the knowledge and skills necessary for responsible AI utilization. This platform focuses on teaching key aspects such as prompt engineering, identifying misinformation in outputs generated by ChatGPT, and understanding the nuances of using AI in educational settings. After the completion of the project, I independently used our materials to create this iOS app.

**Objectives**
Enhance Digital Literacy: Equip students with the ability to navigate and leverage AI technologies effectively, enhancing their overall digital competencies.
Educate on Responsible AI Use: Foster an understanding of ethical AI use in educational environments, ensuring students are well-prepared for a digitally driven future.
**Features**
Interactive Quizes: Engaging and fun activities that reinforce learning objectives and concepts.
Informative Prompts: Thought-provoking challenges to enhance understanding and application of AI tools.
